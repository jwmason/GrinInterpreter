# GrinInterpreter

This program serves as an interpreter for the Grin programming language.
Grin is a simple language that allows the execution of statements and
expressions provided through standard input. The interpreter reads lines
of Grin code from the Python shell's standard input, processes and evaluates
them, and then prints the output to the standard output.
